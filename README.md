> **Uber for Artisans — Built on Stellar**

Stellarts is a decentralized, location-based marketplace that connects skilled artisans with nearby clients, enabling **fast discovery**, **trusted engagement**, and **secure payments** powered by the **Stellar blockchain**.

---

## 🚀 Overview

In many regions—especially emerging markets—finding reliable artisans such as plumbers, electricians, carpenters, mechanics, or tailors still relies heavily on word of mouth. This leads to:

- Difficulty discovering trusted service providers  
- Limited visibility and income opportunities for artisans  
- Payment disputes and lack of accountability  

**Stellarts solves this problem** by combining geolocation, reputation, and Stellar-based escrow payments into a single transparent platform.
