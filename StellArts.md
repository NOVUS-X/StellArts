> **Uber for Artisans — Built on Stellar**  

Stellarts is a decentralized marketplace platform designed to seamlessly connect artisans with clients within their geographical location. Leveraging the **Stellar blockchain**, Stellarts enables trusted, transparent, and fast transactions between service providers (artisans) and seekers (clients).

## 🚀 Vision  

In many communities, finding skilled and reliable artisans — plumbers, carpenters, electricians, tailors, mechanics, painters, etc. — is still based on word of mouth or scattered directories. Clients struggle to discover verified artisans nearby, and artisans often lack visibility to potential customers.  

Stellarts bridges this gap by:  
- Providing **location-based matching** between artisans and clients.  
- Enabling **secure escrow payments** powered by Stellar smart contracts.  
- Building **trust** through a decentralized reputation system.

  - Clients deposit payments into escrow.  
  - Funds are released automatically once the work is confirmed.
